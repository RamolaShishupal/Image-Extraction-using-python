This page is about the current warming of the Earth's climate system. "Climate change" can also refer to climate trends at any point in Earth's history. For other uses see Global warming (disambiguation).

Average global temperatures from 2014 to 2018 compared to a baseline average from 1951 to 1980, according to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

The average annual temperature at the earth's surface has risen since the late 1800s, with year-to-year variations (shown in black) being smoothed out (shown in red) to show the general warming trend.
Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. It is a major aspect of current climate change, and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.[1][2] The term commonly refers to the mainly human-caused increase in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation.[3][4] In this context, the terms global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably,[5] but climate change includes both global warming and its effects, such as changes in precipitation and impacts that differ by region.[6] There were prehistoric periods of global warming,[7] but observed changes since the mid-20th century have been much greater than those seen in previous records covering decades to thousands of years.[1][8]

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report concluded, "It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century."[9] The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 °C (0.5 to 3.1 °F) in a moderate scenario, or as much as 2.6 to 4.8 °C (4.7 to 8.6 °F) in an extreme scenario, depending on the rate of future greenhouse gas emissions and on climate feedback effects.[10] These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations[11] and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.[12][13]

The effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, and expansion of deserts.[14] Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic, which has contributed to the retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. Overall, higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall, but for some regions droughts and wildfires increase instead.[15] Climate change threatens to diminish crop yields, harming food security, and rising sea levels may flood coastal infrastructure and force the abandonment of many coastal cities.[16][17] Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately the environments of coral reefs,[18] mountains, and the Arctic.[19] Due to the persistence of CO2 in the atmosphere and the inertia of the climate system, climatic changes and their effects will continue for millennia even if carbon emissions are stopped.[20]

Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction, adaptation to its effects, and maybe climate engineering. Countries work together on climate change under the umbrella of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has near-universal membership. The ultimate goal of the convention is to "prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system".[21] Although the parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required[22] and that global warming should be limited to well below 2 °C (3.6 °F) in the Paris Agreement,[23] the Earth's average surface temperature has already increased by about half this threshold[24] and current pledges by countries to cut emissions are inadequate to limit future warming.[25] Some scientists question the feasibility, in higher emissions scenarios, of climate adaptation.[26]


Observed temperature changes

Global average temperatures declined for thousands of years, until fossil fuel-based industrialization beginning roughly 200 years ago reversed the decline. Global warming has intensified in recent decades.

Scientists have investigated many possible causes of global warming, and have found that accumulation in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases, especially those resulting from humans burning fossil fuels, is the predominant cause.

Climate proxy records show that natural variations offset the early effects of the Industrial Revolution, so there was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century,[27][28] when thermometer records began to provide global coverage.[29] The IPCC has adopted the baseline reference period 1850–1900 as an approximation of pre-industrial global mean surface temperature.[27]

Multiple independently produced instrumental datasets confirm that the 2009–2018 decade was 0.93 ± 0.07 °C warmer than the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900).[30] Currently, surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2 °C per decade.[31] Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights have decreased, and the number of warm days and night have increased.[32] Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, were not as synchronous as current warming, but may have reached temperatures as high as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions.[33]

Although the most common measure of global warming is the increase in the near-surface atmospheric temperature, over 90% of the additional energy stored in the climate system over the last 50 years has warmed ocean water.[34] The remainder of the additional energy has melted ice and warmed the continents and the atmosphere.[35]

The warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations, documented by many independent scientific groups;[36] for example, in most continental regions the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation has increased.[37] Further examples include sea level rise,[38] widespread melting of snow and land ice,[39] increased heat content of the oceans,[40] increased humidity,[41] and the earlier timing of spring events,[42] such as the flowering of plants.[43]

Regional trends

Average annual temperature has risen faster on land than on the ice-free surface of the sea.

Global warming refers to global averages, with the amount of warming varying by region. Since the pre-industrial period, global average land temperatures have increased almost twice as fast as global average temperatures.[44] This is due to the larger heat capacity of oceans and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation.[45] Patterns of warming are independent of the locations of greenhouse gas emissions because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet; however, localized black carbon deposits on snow and ice do contribute to Arctic warming.[46]

The Northern Hemisphere and North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but the arrangement of land masses around the Arctic Ocean has resulted in the maximum surface area flipping from reflective snow and ice cover to ocean and land surfaces that absorb more sunlight and thus more heat.[47] Arctic temperatures have increased and are predicted to continue to increase during this century at over twice the rate of the rest of the world.[48] As the temperature difference between the Arctic and the equator decreases, ocean currents that are driven by that temperature difference, like the Gulf Stream, are weakening.[49]

Short-term slowdowns and surges
Because the climate system has large thermal inertia, it can take centuries for the climate to fully adjust. While record-breaking years attract considerable public interest, individual years are less significant than the overall trend. Global surface temperature is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlie long-term trends, and can temporarily mask or magnify them.[50] An example of such an episode is the slower rate of surface temperature increase from 1998 to 2012, which was dubbed the global warming hiatus.[51] Throughout this period ocean heat storage continued to progress steadily upwards, and in subsequent years surface temperatures have spiked upwards. The slower pace of warming can be attributed to a combination of natural fluctuations, reduced solar activity, and increased volcanic activity.[52]

Physical drivers of recent climate change

Main article: Attribution of recent climate change
By itself, the climate system experiences various cycles which can last for years (such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation) to decades[53] or centuries.[54] Other changes are caused by external forcings. These forcings are "external" to the climate system, but not always external to the Earth.[55] Examples of external forcings include changes in the composition of the atmosphere (e.g. increased concentrations of greenhouse gases), solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.[56]

Attributing detected temperature changes and extreme events to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases requires scientists to rule out known internal climate variability and natural external forcings. Therefore, a key approach is to use physically or statistically based computer modelling of the climate system to determine unique fingerprints for all potential causes. By comparing these fingerprints with observed patterns and evolution of climate change, and the observed evolution of the forcings, the causes of the observed changes can be determined.[57] Scientists have determined that the major factors causing the current climate change are greenhouse gases, land use changes, and aerosols and soot.[58]
